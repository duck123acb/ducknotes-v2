## READ
OK SO BASICALLY AFTER LIKE 52 BILLION YEARS IM REVAMPING THE SITE  
FINNA BE FIRE

so i think there are gonna be different nodes 
- rich text nodes
- calc node
- todo node
- media nodes (maybe, maybe not)
- possibly a drawing/sketch node although thats under heavy consideration (ill think about it after finishing the rest lol)
- code node (syntax highlighting mode ig)
- ill definitely add more if needed/wanted :D

so uhhhh like the gpt is kinda helpful so these are the ui things i gotta do:
- Monochrome Palette with Accent Color: Stick to a grayscale color scheme for the main elements, then add a single accent color (maybe a muted teal or electric blue) for interactive elements like buttons, links, or highlights. This makes the interface subtle yet eye-catching.
- Subtle Gradients: Apply very light, almost imperceptible gradients in background sections to add depth. Itâ€™s a modern way to bring a bit of visual interest without distracting from the minimal feel.
- Sleek, Rounded Corners: Use rounded edges for input fields, buttons, and boxes. This adds a soft, welcoming feel that makes the interface look cleaner and more refined.
- Frosted Glass Effect: For pop-ups or overlays, a frosted glass look can be really appealing, with some blurring in the background to keep the focus on content but add a bit of texture.
- Dynamic Shadows and Glows: Give elements like the save/load buttons or document mode selectors a subtle shadow or glowing edge when selected, which feels interactive and modern without cluttering.
- soft lines for sections
- maybe spotify/yt music integration to shift the colour palette based on the song (actually considering this one)

features:
- search
- rearranging nodes
